# Hi!
### I see you have discovered JontyMC.gg, a discord bot that returns some basic info about an mc server in a nice embed :)
If you want to get this bot running on your machine, then youll need to do a few things.
1. Ensure you have [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or above installed on your system.
2. Install the contents of requirements.txt with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a Bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications/.
4. create the following files:
   - `prefixes.json`
   - `.env`
   - and a `favicons` directory
5. Copy your bot token into the `.env` file.
6. JontyMC.gg should now be able to run!
